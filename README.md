<H1>**Bilevel Hyper Local Search Algorithm for Hyperparameter Optimization**</H1>
(Paper to be available soon)

> **Abstract** We introduce a linear programming-based hyper local search approach for
hyperparameter tuning of any machine learning model. The approach finetunes
continuous hyperparameters and model parameters through a linear program,
enhancing model generalization near the initial model. The proposed method converts
hyperparameter optimization into a bilevel program and identifies a descent direction to
improve validation loss. The results in the paper show that the linear program
consistently boosts model quality in validation and test performance for all the
considered cases.

> This repository contains the initial working code for a hyper local search algorithm. For detailed "readmi" file to deal with the code, see the folder "Example Jupyter Notebooks" which contain detailed directions and, data and pre-trained models to be directly usable for local tuning.
