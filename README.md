# **Bilevel Hyper Local Search Algorithm for Hyperparameter Optimization**
(Paper to be available soon)

> **Abstract** We introduce a linear programming-based hyper local search approach for
hyperparameter tuning of any machine learning model. The approach finetunes
continuous hyperparameters and model parameters through a linear program,
enhancing model generalization near the initial model. The proposed method converts
hyperparameter optimization into a bilevel program and identifies a descent direction to
improve validation loss. The results in the paper show that the linear program
consistently boosts model quality in validation and test performance for all the
considered cases.

> This repository contains the initial working code for a hyper local search algorithm. For detailed "readmi" file to deal with the code, see the folder "Jupyter Notebooks" which has example notebooks and contains detailed directions. The folder also has data and optuna trained models to be directly usable for local tuning.
